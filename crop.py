### 🧐 Why **{crop_name}** is Recommended?
- **Soil Type**: {soil_input} is ideal for {crop_name}'s root development.
- **State**: In {state_input}, this crop is commonly grown in similar climate.
- **Rainfall**: {rain}mm matches the water requirement of {crop_name}.
- **Temperature**: {temp}°C provides an optimal growing condition.
- **Humidity**: {humi}% helps in efficient transpiration and disease resistance.

### ❌ Why Other Crops May Not Suit
Other crops might require:
- Different soil (e.g., Sandy instead of Loamy)
- More or less rainfall (e.g., 300mm+)
- Temperature beyond the current season’s capability
- Region-specific limitations or pest vulnerabilities
